# Move apps from your Personal to an enterprise subscription

**We'll help you transfer applications** when you upgrade from a Personal Edition to a paid subscription.

After you subscribe to an OutSystems edition, go to our Support Portal and request the transfer of your applications, providing your Personal Environment email and your subscription Activation Code.

**FAQs:**

*Can I transfer more apps from my Personal Edition in the future?*

Following the terms of the use of the Personal Edition, you can share your apps with the Community, through the Forge. If you do not intend to share your apps with the Community, develop them in your paid subscription. OutSystems evaluates each transfer request, and will consider only one request for each new customer.
