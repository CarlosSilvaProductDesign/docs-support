# Support Email Deactivation 

At OutSystems, we strive to make your interactions with us smooth and frictionless. With this important goal in mind, we are announcing a change to our online support channels.

## What's changing?
In  analyzing your feedback and our internal processes, we found that our support@outsystems.com email channel was not producing the amazing support experiences we expect. Consequently, we decided to deactivate this email account and its ticket-generation process, and to consolidate online communications in our [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support). 

## When will this change take effect?
Effective July 15th, 2021, you will no longer be able to create support tickets by emailing support@outsystems.com. Instead, you can create tickets through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support) or by [phone](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support).

## Why are we doing this?
Analysis revealed that email-generated support tickets did not enable our support team to provide the effective and contextualized support experience you deserve. Additionally, consolidating online communications in our [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support) will enable us to personalize the support experience to meet your individual needs.  

## How can I create support tickets?
We encourage you to contact OutSystems Support by [phone](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) or through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).

## Understood, so what's next?
Between now and July 15th, 2021, creating a new support ticket by email will generate a response that reminds you of the upcoming change. After July 15th, XXXX?? 

Remember we are always here for you!
