# Change to our email support channel

At OutSystems, we strive to make your interactions with us smooth and frictionless. With this important goal in mind, we're announcing a change to our email support channel.

## What's changing?

We're deactivating the support@outsystems.com email account and its ticket-generation process, and consolidating online communications in our 
[Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support). 
To create a support ticket, [call us](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) or use the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).

## When does this change take effect?
Effective July 15th, 2021, you can no longer create support tickets by emailing support@outsystems.com. Instead, you can create tickets through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support) or by [phone](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support).

## Why are we doing this?
Consolidating online communications in our [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support) enables us to personalize the support experience to meet your individual needs.

## How can I create support tickets?
We encourage you to contact OutSystems Support by [phone](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) or through the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).

## Understood, so what's next?
Until July 15th, 2021, creating a new support ticket by email generates a response that reminds you about the upcoming change. After July 15th, emails no longer create tickets, and you receive an auto-reply that directs you to the [Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).

Remember that we're always here for you!
