## Other ways to use Service Studio on macOS

If you don't want to be an early adopter of the new cross-platform Service Studio, you can still use Service Studio on your Mac with a virtual machine running Windows and the latest supported version of the [Service Studio development environment for Windows](https://www.outsystems.com/Downloads/). Check the [development environment system requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_system_requirements#Development_tools).
