# How do I transition from the OutSystems Public Cloud to on-premises?

To move from the OutSystems Public cloud to on-premises, or to another Public Cloud, follow the steps below. You may transition one environment at a time, effectively building a hybrid deployment.

1. Set up the physical infrastructure and network connectivity. Don't forget connectivity to external APIs and databases.

2. [Install the OutSystems Platform](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems).

3. Contact [OutSystems Support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) to get the license(s) you will need for your on-premise installations.

4. Import the data from the OutSystems Public Cloud. You have a few options, such as:

    1. Direct database access credentials and third-party database tools;

    2. Develop your own data extraction mechanism with OutSystems.

    3. This applies to application data. For further information on metadata migrations please [contact support](https://www.outsystems.com/goto/contact-outsystems-support).
