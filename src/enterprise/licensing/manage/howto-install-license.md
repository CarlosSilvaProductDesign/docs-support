Follow these steps to install the license file on your environment:

1. Navigate to the environment management console at `http://<yourenvironment>/ServiceCenter`;

2. Click the '**Administration**' tab, and navigate to the '**Licensing**' submenu;

3. Use the '**Backup License**' link to download the license currently installed. It's always a good idea to keep backups;

4. Click the '**Upload New License**' link, to install the new license.

License files are bound to a given environment / Serial Number and if you try to install them on other environments you'll get an error.

If that happens confirm that you downloaded the right file by comparing the Serial Numbers shown in Service Center and Licensing Portal.
