# OutSystems Product Releases

## Release Terminology

### Major Release

As the name suggests, this type of release introduces significant and important features, along with bug fixes of all severity levels. This kind of release can have breaking changes.

### Release

A version associated with a Major Release that can include new features or significant improvements to current functionalities, along with bug fixes of all severity levels. This kind of release can also have breaking changes but in a less number compared with Major Releases.

### Cumulative Patch

Meant to be a patch to an existing release with less impact and risk-free, Cumulative Patches (CP) introduce minor improvements of current functionalities or bug fixes of all severity levels. A new cumulative patch does not introduce breaking changes to the associated release. 

### Hotfix

Custom product component version built on demand for a specific customer(s) to unblock a critical issue without an acceptable workaround. Hotfixes are private (not publicly available) and delivered to customers via the Product Support team.

### Early Access Program (EAP)

These are programs managed by OutSystems, providing early access to OutSystems new capabilities as they roll out. You can check the list of currently open Early Access Programs (EAP) and [apply to them](https://www.outsystems.com/eap/). Only a set of selected customers are on-boarded on these programs.

### Beta

Currently, Beta releases apply only to [Service Studio](https://www.outsystems.com/home/beta) and [MABS](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Delivering_Mobile_Apps/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service). Beta releases include a set of capabilities that will soon be released in General Availability. It can be seen as similar to Early Access, but it's related to a specific version of the product as a whole, instead of just a specific feature.

### Technical Preview

Technical Previews offered by OutSystems are meant to prove a given technology or approach from all perspectives including robustness and fit to customersâ€™ use cases. Because these are just a preview of the feature, some quirks may happen from time to time. The current functionalities in Technical Preview are [Container Deployment](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Maintenance_and_Operations/Container_Deployment_Technical_Preview_Program) and [OutSystems Service Studio for Mac](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Maintenance_and_Operations/OutSystems_Service_Studio_for_Mac).
