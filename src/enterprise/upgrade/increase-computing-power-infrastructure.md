# Increase the computing power of your infrastructure

OutSystems Platform **supports for horizontal and vertical scalability** so you can scale the computing resources to the demands of your applications.

If you're using the OutSystems PaaS, to increase the computing resources of your infrastructure:

1. Contact your account manager for pricing details.

2. [Reach out to support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) to ask for more computing resources. Our support engineers will help you find the best option according to your requirements.

3. Choose a schedule for the upgrade. This requires some downtime, so be sure to choose a time that doesn't have an impact for your business.
