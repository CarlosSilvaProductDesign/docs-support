# How the BADLOCK vulnerability affects your OutSystems Platform

## Overview

The BADLOCK attack is a Man in the Middle attack on Samba (Windows file share) protocol. This potentially allows remote code execution and impersonating a user, as well as Denial Of Service.

## Affected Stacks and Versions

The OutSystems Platform does not make use of this service and typically OutSystems Platform servers will not have this enabled, so in standard installations this will not be a problem for your OutSystems Platform server.

You may be affected if you use these services on your solution, or because your server is working as more than just an OutSystems Platform server.

## How do I fix the issue

Both Samba and Microsoft have released patches which fix the vulnerabilities, so all you have to do  is update your system.
