# Overview

## What can I expect to find in the Forge?

The Forge is an OutSystems repository that enables community users to share and collaborate in software projects. Those software projects can be:

* Applications
* Integrations
* Device capabilities
* User Interface
* Functional libraries & utilities
* Development tools
* Demos & samples

The Forge is also the place where OutSystems Partners distribute their Business Solutions, which are pre-built solutions created by market specialists with industry expertise.

OutSystems also uses the Forge to distribute components that extend the platform’s capabilities. This enables faster and agile releases to the community, as these components are separate from the platform release cycle.

## What do you mean when you say "open-source projects"? 

Individual contributors who share projects (that aren't Business Solutions) in the Forge follow a BSD licensing model, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of covered software. A project’s code is provided as-is and can be reused and changed at will. We believe this model promotes OutSystems Community collaboration. However, the open nature of the OutSystems Forge does not prevent individual contributors from sharing projects with other types of licenses, such as GPL. OutSystems doesn't monitor the licensing terms for any projects shared in the Forge by community members. It's the sole responsibility of the user of projects in the Forge to verify the licensing model being used and to comply with the respective terms.

## Can I share my work in the Forge?

Yes. All members of the OutSystems Community can share their work. You can either start your own project from scratch or join a team that's already working on an existing one and contribute your expertise.

Before sharing your project take into consideration that Forge is the place where the Community goes to accelerate development work or get a better grasp of how to implement a specific use case. Publishing test applications or code that is only to be shared with a specific small group of people do not fit this goal and because of that will be removed or rejected.

## What kind of projects can I share or use?

Software projects in Forge belong to one of the following categories:

### Applications

Fully working apps for different use cases that you can start using immediately or customize to fit your needs.

[Directory Mobile](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1397/directory-mobile) and [Order Management](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/8878/order-management?) are examples of Applications.

### Integrations

Connections with systems external to OutSystems that enable additional functionalities on your apps.

### Device capabilities

Plugins that extend the features of your apps by allowing access to the capabilities of mobile devices.

[Camera Plugin](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1390/camera-plugin) and [Key Store Plugin](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1550/key-store-plugin) are examples of Device capabilities projects.

### User interface

Themes, layouts, patterns, and widgets that allow you to build great-looking apps in no time.

[OutSystems UI](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1385/outsystems-ui) and [Google Maps](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1396/google-maps-library) are examples of User interface projects.

### Functional libraries & utilities

Programming functions and utilities to develop and extend the end-user functionalities in your apps.

[JavaScript Utils](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component/1392/javascript-utils) is an example of a Functional libraries & utilities project.

### Development tools

Components, frameworks, and libraries that support the developer in the app lifecycle management and CI/CD processes.

The [Case Management framework](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9179/case-management-framework) is an example of a Development tools project.

### Demos & samples

Guides and examples that demonstrate how specific tasks, capabilities, or how components work.

[OutSystems Maps Sample](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/10984/outsystems-maps-sample) and [Data Grid Sample Reactive](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9765/data-grid-sample-reactive) are examples of Demos & samples projects.

## What is an OutSystems Supported project?

An OutSystems Supported project is a component or application that's developed, maintained, and supported by OutSystems under the terms of a customer's subscription. Supported components are distributed in two different ways:

* As open source, allowing customers to change them for their own needs. However, once a customer has changed them, such components will no longer be supported by OutSystems.

* As a closed component that doesn’t allow customization. As part of the product, these components are under intellectual property protection.

## What is a featured project?

A featured project is a component or application, not necessarily developed by OutSystems, that we believe is valuable to customers, either because of its functionality or its content.

## What is a deprecated project?

A deprecated project is a component or application that's no longer suitable or recommended for download. Most likely this is because another project with equivalent functionality has replaced it.

## How do I get support for a specific project?

Customers with an active subscription to OutSystems can submit a request via the OutSystems Support Portal for OutSystems Supported projects.

Community support is available for other projects. Browse to the discussions tab on the project's page and review existing answers. If you don't find what you're looking for, start a new thread.
